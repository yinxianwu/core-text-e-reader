<font color="black" strokeColor="gray" face="BODY_FONT">Even with a Eurail Pass, this train commands a burly surcharge. But it’s <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">so<font face="BODY_FONT"> worth it: curtained windows and plush appointments all in burgundy. The whole train is painted burgundy, in fact, livery of the super-express Thalys line that makes the run between Amsterdam and Paris. We rocket into France at 300 kilometers per hour, the wheat fields and trees out the window blurring into impressionistic stop motion. I’m served a lunch of cold fish—doesn’t sound so appetizing but surprisingly is. Most scintillating of all: Wi-Fi Internet access on board. Oh, I really don’t need to surf the web, and all those travel homilies about unplugging from the grid are not misplaced…but it’s just <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">way too cool<font face="BODY_FONT"> to avoid entirely.

I’m not sure what I will think of Gay Paree. On the one hand, I adore cities, and Paris is perhaps the Platonic ideal of one. On the other, I’m somewhat blasé about the whole French thing after a childhood lived in the world’s second-biggest franco-town.

Arrival at Gare du Nord, a couple of metro rides, and I emerge on a street near Place de la Bastille and all misgivings evaporate.

<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Wow, it’s beautiful.<font face="BODY_FONT">

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/RueVoltaireHausmannStyleBldgs.jpg" width="320" height="240">

It’s just a random long, straight Parisian thoroughfare: five-ish-story apartment blocks of almond and cream, wrought-iron curlicued balconies, black mansard rooflines. Neon-lit green crosses denote local pharmacies offering a bewildering array of beauty products. A gas station blends perfectly into the fabric, a tiny curbside affair with a couple of pumps. Everything’s so well-proportioned, so harmonious, so <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Paris<font face="BODY_FONT">. I pull out my iPod and put on the slo-mo thump of MC Solaar’s “Le Belle et le Bad Boy” to complete the effect.

Dinnertime. To heck with guidebook recommendations: I speak the language and want to test out the city’s foodie rep. I’ll pick a place more-or-less at random. I wander, partly aimlessly, westward from the sprawling traffic circle of Place de la Bastille. Its gold-leaf angel monument prances skyward in the dusky light while serpentine Art Nouveau metro signs beckon away from the street. But I stay aboveground, on foot, reaching the Seine and one of its islands, Île St-Louis. Settling in as a <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">brasserie<font face="BODY_FONT"> (or is it a <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">bistrot<font face="BODY_FONT">?), I order a plate of grilled duck and cross my fingers as it arrives.

<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Magnifique!<font face="BODY_FONT"> Succulent and flavorful, arguably one of the best preparations of the dish I’ve had. I now comprehend Julia Child’s religious conversion over <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">sole meunière<font face="BODY_FONT">.

Lightning strikes again the next morning: seeking a place to go online (my somewhat fleabaggy hotel is not so endowed), I pop into a neighborhood <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">brasserie<font face="BODY_FONT"> and order a dish in a hurry. Smoked salmon, poached eggs and cream, all in an ice-cream-sundae-style cup…impossibly delicious.

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Focus on the unexpected<font face="BODY_FONT">. That’s my mantra in a city of clichés. At the Musée d’Orsay I spy a more obscure bit of pointillism: <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Les Îles d’Or<font face="BODY_FONT">, the golden islands, by Henri-Edmond Cross. Simple, Rothko-like sea-and-sky blues, a dreamlike hazy blur.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/OrsayCrossLesIlesDorPtg.jpg" width="240" height="320">

Never mind the Eiffel Tower: nearby and uncrowded, the Arc de Triomphe is climbable…though at 200 or so steps, probably a feeble effort to burn off calories earned in this town. Still, a view beguiling in its symmetry in the blue haze: in one direction, the super-broadness of the Champs-Élysées; in the other, the Grande Arche of La Défense—a supersized hollowed-out cube of steel that presides at the center of the city’s skyscraper district. A city core as perfectly wrought as this chose a generation or two ago to relegate its modern towers of business to the outskirts. This could be brave urban planning or museumification. I’m not sure which…but then, what part of this place would you tear down to build taller?

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/ArcDeTriompheAveToLaDefenseView.jpg" width="320" height="240">

Back on the ground and back to matters gastronomic. The waiter spots my English-language guidebook, hears my respectable French and inquires sunnily, “<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Canadien<font face="BODY_FONT">?” So far I’ve encountered none of the reputed snobbery against <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Quebecois<font face="BODY_FONT"> French. And my pizza is as delightful as any local cuisine: I try a four-cheese impregnated with full-on slices of brie and crumbles of blue cheese. <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Formidable<font face="BODY_FONT">. I wonder if the Italians will be able to top it. 

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

“All it is is a bunch of people pushing and shoving and there’s <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">so many better things<font face="BODY_FONT"> to see in that museum.”

So offers Ryan during our weekly chat. Paris is the one city in Europe he’s visited, and like most everyone else I’ve spoken to over the years, he echoes the received opinion of the “Mona Lisa”: underwhelming. I could be mistaken, but I also sense he’s eager to offer up this point: <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">see, I’ve traveled too<font face="BODY_FONT">.  

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/Louvre2Pyramids2.jpg" width="240" height="320">

As I enter the Louvre through the iconic glass pyramid, I plan on spending maybe three minutes gazing upon Mona, like that scene in <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Fiddler on the Roof<font face="BODY_FONT"> where paterfamilias Tevye, after ranting and raving about the urgent need to see his granddaughter, waltzes into his daughter’s home, glances at the newborn, then turns and marches out. Mission accomplished.  

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/LouvreMultimediaGuide.jpg" width="320" height="240">

I snag a <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">haute technologie<font face="BODY_FONT"> multimedia guide; the world’s biggest art museum has embraced the future, replacing those tinny canned-audio devices with handheld touch screens. Makes Mona that much easier to find. Not that I’d need much help: entering the long gallery, I see them, the ever-present beehive of amateur photographers fawning over the art world’s red-carpet celebrity. No velvet ropes, however; instead, a wooden railing extending a dozen feet in a semicircle around the painting. The work itself is covered by glass and flanked by two security guards, just as everyone’s said.

And yet…I gaze at the art world’s biggest superstar and she coolly gazes back. Even some distance away the effect is hypnotic. <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">I can’t take my eyes off it<font face="BODY_FONT">. It’s inscrutable, confounding, serene. I feel—wait for it—a tremble. Yes, the work is gloomy—due to dirt no one dare remove for fear of disturbing the paint—lending it a foreboding that clashes perfectly with its luminous play of light.

Downstairs, another marquee work fascinates: I never got what was so special about the “Venus de Milo”, parodied endlessly on T-shirts and souvenir mugs. <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">It’s the arms, stupid<font face="BODY_FONT">. Or rather, the absence of them: nobody knows what they looked like. The stumps provide glorious incompleteness, perpetual embrace by invisible limbs.

The museum’s too big to see in a day, and probably a week—but the multimedia guide has a solution: compact, self-guided walking tours. Here again, I want to know how this place became what it is. Ah, perfect: an architectural history walk.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/LouvreMedievalRuinsCastle.jpg" width="320" height="240">

The Louvre wasn’t always a museum; instead, I discover, it was the original royal palace, the home of French rulership until Louis XIV decamped for Versailles in the 1700s. Consequently, the place is a hodgepodge of periods and styles; the pyramid, alternately reviled and revered—thank you, Dan Brown—is but the latest addition. Building this newest bit unveiled the oldest: the foundations of the original castle were then discovered. The guide’s digital screen walks me down to the lowest levels where smooth walls and round medieval turrets of stone are backlit by halogen lights. 

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

I always thought of Paris as a sunny counterpoint to gloomy London, but the two cities actually share similar climates. A raw October wind blows drizzle as I cross the small bridge on the Seine to Île de la Cité. They say it all started here: the Parisii tribe of Celtic Iron Age nomads found this convenient place to ford the river, and from that a settlement sprang up. Of such caprice great cities are made. Nowadays the island is better known for a lumbering Gothic beast, the cathedral to end all cathedrals. Notre Dame de Paris.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/NotreDameRelief3.jpg" width="240" height="320">

It took almost 200 years to complete. It feels to me like every gray stone on Earth went into its construction. With flying buttresses holding up its gargantuan core like spider legs, a central nave stretching on for what feels like forever, and an imposing triple-arched front entrance replete with stone-carved figurines, I’m quickly overwhelmed—probably the intended effect for a religion long on pomp and circumstance. I spend well over an hour wandering and exploring its chapels and nooks and still come away feeling like I’ve barely scratched the surface.

<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Religion again<font face="BODY_FONT">. It’s ironic that now-secular Europe basks in so rich a religious architectural heritage, while spiritually fervid America must content itself with banalities like the Crystal Cathedral. And yet, for all that this place is a wonder, I remain unmoved by its intended aim.

<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Why isn’t this doing it for me?<font face="BODY_FONT">

Maybe those mantras about traits skipping a generation offer clues: my grandparents rejected religion too. On my father’s side, a family scattered all over the world left tradition behind: there’s an early photo of my dad sitting under a huge Christmas tree—not out of devotion to Christianity but out of my grandparents’ bid to keep up with the Joneses of the time. My mother’s side saw a keener pull toward Jewish peoplehood—but in the form of radical secular Zionism. It was my parents who rediscovered religion, sending us all to Hebrew schools to study our heritage. But it never stuck, and I cultivated a pronounced uninterest in piety. Seems I’m not alone: after <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">la révolution <font face="BODY_FONT">the cathedral was reconsecrated to “The Cult of Reason.”

I’m more captivated by a diorama showing how the place was built; it arguably was one of the engineering and architectural triumphs of the age. As with St. Patrick’s in Dublin, faith may have catalyzed but human ingenuity willed this wonder into creation.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/SacreCoeurCathedral.jpg" width="320" height="240">

The wind and rain give way, gray clouds now punctuated by shafts of sun. A view would be nice. Up the funicular railway at Montmartre to the top of the <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">butte<font face="BODY_FONT">, Paris’s only real hill. At the top, Sacré-Coeur Cathedral, a faux-Byzantine wedding cake of a place from the late 1800s. <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Now who’s Disney-fied, bitches<font face="BODY_FONT">? The French probably fail to appreciate how theme-parky are some constructs in their midst. On the way down, a <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">boulangerie<font face="BODY_FONT"> beckons with baguettes; I’m nearly as much a bread addict as I am a choco-junkie. The waistline isn’t thrilled.

I don’t know anyone in Paris—or so I thought until Renaissance Man’s roommate tells me to contact her friend Ashley from the States who’s studying here for a spell. We meet at the Moulin Rouge windmill—though at €90-plus a pop for its floor show we move on, opting for a neighborhood <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">bistrot<font face="BODY_FONT"> instead.

“Try the pork loin,” she suggests, between talk of Paris student life and travel tales. It’s in a honey-curry sauce and is predictably spectacular. Then the grandest news of all: a <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">gâteau au chocolat fondant<font face="BODY_FONT">—a molten flourless wonder.

“Oh, yeah!” Ashley exclaims. A fellow choco-addict. As a weak nod to portion control we partition it when it arrives, though it’s dense enough that half is plenty. Oh, that waistline. 

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

The RER commuter train to Versailles is surprisingly grungy. Though perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised: as we ride out, Paris’s picture-perfect <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">arrondissements<font face="BODY_FONT"> give way to the battleship concrete high-rises of the <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">banlieues<font face="BODY_FONT">, the city’s suburbs. It’s America inside-out: the money’s in the inner city. Not that this arrangement is much better: the nation’s segregated Muslim minority rioted out here a couple summers back.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/VersaillesJeffKoonsBaloonDog.jpg" width="320" height="240">

The Palace of Versailles itself, meanwhile, is akin to an American suburb: a planned community palace. King Louis had his motives, though, for <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">haute<font face="BODY_FONT">-flight to the burbs: easier to manage those drama-queen nobles in a compound out here in the country.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/VersaillesHallMirrorsJeffKoonsRefl.jpg" width="320" height="240">

To modern eyes it’s blindingly overdone, an orgy of curlicued detailing and chandeliers and canopied beds and gilt-encrusted everything. I’m almost grateful for a temporary Jeff Koons exhibit: cute balloon sculptures—the big silver ball reflecting the Hall of Mirrors in fun-house distortion is especially beguiling—cleverly inserted between the frills and gold leaf.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/VersaillesViewFromOrangerie2.jpg" width="240" height="320">

Like latter-day suburbia this place is all open spaces looked after by a horticultural army. An even line of perfectly trimmed conical bushes in the Orangerie stands at attention against the cream-toned building and the ink-stained gray of a cloudy sky. That’s right: this place was a <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">summer<font face="BODY_FONT"> palace. With fountains switched off the iconic gardens feel as lonely and barren as a wintertime Minnesota parking lot. 

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

Okay, enough museums and treasures. Time to be <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">un bad boy<font face="BODY_FONT">.

To start with, a bar in the Marais. I’m heartened that Paris’s gay town is also in one of its most distinctive quarters. As I become more familiar with the city I find myself drawn to its unreconstituted medieval parts, such as this neighborhood or the <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">quartier latin<font face="BODY_FONT"> on the Left Bank. Baron Haussmann’s nineteenth-century bout of urban renewal, wide boulevards and endless mansard roofs, has begun to feel monotonous.

<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Just like riding a bike<font face="BODY_FONT">. Or so I hope: my rusty Montréal French has been useful enough for ordering food in restaurants, so now time for a <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">real<font face="BODY_FONT"> test—chatting up a gorgeous local. There he is, across the room: tall, long blonde hair, aquiline nose…and aloof in a way that suggests inexperience. I soon find out why from the chattier, not-so-cute friend.

“<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Il est un modèle.<font face="BODY_FONT">” He’s a model. And eighteen.

So nothing doing there. They leave and I grow chummy with two other cute guys, this time <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">en anglais<font face="BODY_FONT">: a pair of expat Americans, early twentysomethings doing the study-abroad thing. I’m more into Michael, the lean, square jawed Midwesterner, but his friend Erik, a Latino from New York, is more into me. We dance together, though it’s decidedly chaste—especially since Erik works to keep his drunken friend apart from a Spanish boy who fancies him. <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Le cock bloquage<font face="BODY_FONT">.  

“We always go home together,” Erik states. Hooking up is so <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">gauche<font face="BODY_FONT">, he implies. Bros before hoes. The <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">faux<font face="BODY_FONT">-propriety of youth.

Off to another venue that takes full advantage of the Marais’s medieval mojo: CUB is tucked into a brick-arched basement, catacomb-like but for the laser lights and disco beats. We dance till dawn, close the place down—Paris nightlife runs late—and ride the metro home as it reopens in the early morning. Erik and Michael decide they want something out of the vending machine parked on the platform but the contraption has other plans. It eats their Euros and gives back nothing. They start banging and kicking it like rowdy children.

“Come on! <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Fucker<font face="BODY_FONT">!”

Pinched Parisians begin to stare, and I can see it in their eyes: <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">les americains<font face="BODY_FONT">. I keep my distance, pretending to gaze at subway maps.

One more roll of the dice the next night, this time at MIX in Montparnasse. Buried under a tall 1960s-era skyscraper, it’s another glitzy mega-club like Heaven in London. The glitz is matched by its drink prices—steep—which given the dollar’s already weak exchange makes me grateful I’m a modest tippler. Emboldened by a solitary vodka and Red Bull I try chatting up a cute bespectacled boy, another early twentysomething, this one a Parisian native.  

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/Niteclub1.jpg" width="240" height="320">

“<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">C’est la plus belle ville au monde<font face="BODY_FONT">,” he asserts. The most beautiful city in the world. A typical boast, though from what I’ve seen not necessarily misplaced. Still, the brashness grates a bit.

“You were <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">really<font face="BODY_FONT"> staring at me,” he smirks. “Why don’t you get us a drink?”

<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Really<font face="BODY_FONT">? I’m hoping I misunderstood over the din and my grasp of the language. Or maybe not. <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Presumptuous too<font face="BODY_FONT">. I let it slide, forking over €10 each for a couple of so-so fruity concoctions. He downs his quickly and then:

“Buy me another.”

Okay, that’s enough. Time for the universal “Go fuck yourself” cue. I excuse myself to go to the bathroom. When I return, he’s blessedly nowhere in sight.

I guess one stuck-up Parisian over an entire week isn’t too bad, but I take it as an omen: time to pack it in. 

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

The seaside café in Monte Carlo affords a splendid view of the yachts, super-yachts, and cruise ships docked in the harbor. Blue skies, balmy temperatures, and little humidity complete the canvas. I see where Charles Trenet got the inspiration for his song “La Mer,” covered in English by Bobby Darin as “Beyond the Sea.”

It’s only 450 or so miles from Paris—about the distance from Boston to Washington, D.C.—but this might as well be another planet. A good thing too: I don’t know if it was my fruitless quest at a boymance there and in Amsterdam, or the incipient chill in the north, but I was finding my mood up there starting to flag. Echoes from the past summer stand like troops massed outside the gates of my subconscious.

Nothing like the sun to offer tonic, though to tell the truth the contrast between here and blustery northern France took me by surprise. For one thing, that speedy TGV train evaporates the distance. Nice’s narrow streets of Second Empire structures vaguely evoke Paris—by way of Santa Barbara. My wee hotel is a comfy upgrade from my dank Parisian digs—and a good bit cheaper.

I keep coming back to these Mediterranean climates. It’s easy to see why, what with their Goldilocks weather and eye-candy geography. All of them—there are only five such regions on Earth—owe their perfect climate to a delicate combination of factors: moderate latitude, well-placed mountains, cool ocean breezes. Well, except for here: the sea is too warm and we’re much too far north; Marseilles is at practically the same latitude as Minneapolis or Montréal, a dispiriting fact I learned in French class one frozen February morning. So what makes this place so special?

For one thing, the Alps. Yes, those snowy mountains so associated with Julie Andrews belting it out in <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">The Sound of Music<font face="BODY_FONT"> in fact terminate right here. I see them, rising up from the coast.<font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC"> Les alpes-maritimes<font face="BODY_FONT">, the French call them. They funnel wind down the Rhône Valley, blowing away all that moisture and chill while keeping humidity from the Mediterranean at bay. The wind even has a name that brings to mind a Greek deity: the mistral.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/RentedScooter.jpg" width="320" height="240">

I know just how to explore this place: on two wheels. I rent a motor scooter from a nearby shop—I’ve got one back home, so it’s all pretty familiar—and head along the coastal corniche roads going east.

Rounding the curve of Villefranche harbor, I spot a cruise ship flanked by smaller boats, a mother goose with babies in tow. The water is that distinctive Mediterranean deep blue—caused by its salinity, they say—with coastal peaks a blend of pearl-shaded rock and emerald forest. An occasional centuries-old building looms around a bend. So far the Riviera’s living up to its hype, beating out similar such drives in California with richness of flora and history.

I reach Monaco and its best-known district, Monte Carlo. It’s been settled since prehistory, more-or-less continuously ruled by one family, the Grimaldi, since the 1200s. Leave it to tinseltown, however, to draw in the crowds: memorials to Princess Grace, Grace Kelly, who married one of the royals and was killed in a car crash in 1982, are everywhere.  

City-states are fragile things, and without creative means of keeping themselves afloat they often perish. In Monaco’s case, casinos did it—a scheme later adopted by Las Vegas and Macau. It’s more of a business center these days than my James Bond-recollected fantasies: industry tends to gravitate toward tax havens like this one, though no doubt the climate doesn’t hurt either.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/MeMonacoAquariumSea.jpg" width="320" height="240">

Perhaps for that reason, Monaco is…something of a letdown. The cliff walks and medieval streets near the palace are entrancing, if a bit touristy, but the rest of the town feels bland: a thicket of soulless high-rises climbing the hills above the bay. The casino’s still oh-so old-world—jacket and tie required to enter. <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">Ixne on that<font face="BODY_FONT">, I consider, gazing at my backpacker duds. Instead I scoot past on my motorbike, 007-style, sending tourists and pigeons scurrying out of the way.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/MoyenneCornicheEzeBridge.jpg" width="320" height="240">

Up on the Moyenne Corniche, the middle road, I stop in Èze, a small hilltop town halfway between Monaco and Nice. The ruins of a fort sit atop a hillside astride an arched viaduct. The blue sea is in the background, perfectly framed by the fecund triangle of the valley. At a small weekend market, people—tourists mostly—buy trinkets, souvenirs, food. Another Disneyland? Maybe: the man himself spent some time here. But Èze doesn’t feel forced. My curiosity is whetted: when does a place tip from popular to overrun, from charming <font face="BODY_FONT_ITALIC">au naturel<font face="BODY_FONT"> to cloying and artificial? So far I haven’t crossed the tipping point, and familiarity hasn’t spelled the death of wonder or crimped my efforts to find emotional escape.
