<font color="black" strokeColor="gray" face="Palatino-Roman">All nomads have a point of origin, in my case this cold-weather metropolis tucked into Canada’s east.

My parents and two out of three sisters still reside here and keep me coming back. Well, not entirely: it’s the little ones who do it, my nieces and nephews. Five of them, to be exact, aged one-and-a-half through six. In spite of the continent that divides us I’ve managed to keep alive a closeness. Practically all the friends of my youth are long gone—a holdover from the bad old days of Quebec secessionism a decade or two back. The upside: my Montréal visits are a concentrated yet enchanting dose of the familial.

To keep things fair to the kids I alternate where I stay on each successive visit and this go-round it’s my sister Tamara’s turn; her younger son, Jacob, celebrates his third birthday during my time here. Like his athletic father—and unlike klutzy Uncle David—Jacob displays a passion for golf. He takes a fancy to the toy plastic putter I buy him for his birthday—so much that my sister and brother-in-law consign his swinging to the backyard to avoid a lot of shattered glass.

All those platitudes about living vicariously through the eyes of a child truly hit home at this time of year. I still vividly recall when the cycle of seasons was measured from September to September: the welter of anticipation, the smell of new markers and pencils, the fall jackets donned for daily commutes to brick schoolhouses. Montréal’s northerly clime is such that even now the chill begins to assert itself. On a rainy, cool morning Jacob’s big sister, Lola, age five, starts kindergarten. Her cousin Jackson, meanwhile, oldest of the brood, begins first grade. Some years ago, immediately following Jackson’s arrival, I composed a “birth letter” to him. In it I prophesied how, one day, we adults would be engaged in our grown-up activities, attending meetings or fiddling with retirement portfolios (traveling around the world or donating organs hadn’t occurred to me yet) while he was trundling home from grade school.

It looks like that day has finally come.

My sisters inhabit lives very different from mine yet it’s safe to say we’ve never been closer. These brief visits serve as concentrated catch-ups on goings-on in our lives: Tamara’s job has been an unrelenting misery so she’s returning to a previous employer; my other sister Naomi and her husband are in the middle of the high-wire act of selling one home and buying another. All those mortgage complexities leave their nights sleepless. Clearly life in one’s thirties, either as a footloose-and-fancy-free American urbanite or as a parent of young children, does not signal the end of change, transition, or uncertainty. This was a conceit of our twenties.

It’s good to be surrounded by loved ones right now, as the tumult I’ve pledged to forget comes lunging back like tentacles in a monster film.

In the middle of a small bon voyage gathering my family throws in my honor, I spot a blinking e-mail notification for me on my mom’s computer. It’s from Steve, my estranged friend. With he in the midst of some minor foot surgery and I in the middle of prepping for this trip we reached something of an <font face="Palatino-Italic">entente cordial<font face="Palatino-Roman"> to leave things for stabler times. Or so I thought.

“What we have is not a friendship,” he admonishes in a hostile screed. He’s done this before—waited until an impending departure to drop a bomb. Always impersonally, always via e-mail. “Try to be intellectually honest,” he adds. He demands closure for the events of this past summer. Now. Immediately. The night before I’m set to fly off.

<font face="Palatino-Italic">Why? Why?<font face="Palatino-Roman"> Last time he did this he was in the throes of drug addiction. But he’s been clean now for years. One of my sisters walks in and sees the missive. She puts her arm on my shoulder.

“Don’t respond. This isn’t the time.”

So much for trying to forget. I try to push it all away, but it casts a gloom over what should be a celebratory time—my maiden voyage across the Atlantic as an adult. Bidding the little ones goodbye the following evening, I hoist my eighty-liter backpack over my shoulders and strap on a money belt for the first time. 

<font face="Palatino-Italic">Weird<font face="Palatino-Roman">. I used to snicker at backpackers in my days of wheelie-bag travel. Off to the airport, down the jetway onto a cavernous British Airways triple-seven. The flight’s barely longer than a transcontinental red-eye and as passengers settle in, doesn’t feel all that different either. That is, until the effortlessly polite, British-accented voice floats dreamily over the PA.

“Please be suhe to store youh possessions in the ovuhead storage lockuh.”

Benadryl makes possible a couple hours of fitful sleep. Awakening somewhere over Galway, I work to stuff the past away in a storage locker in my brain and anticipate the magnitude of what’s ahead: over half a year bashing around Planet Earth with a single bag hanging off my back. How will I take to it after a life spent in offices and classrooms, never away from home for more than a week at a time? Will this offer distraction, consolation, perspective, or just seven more months of reminders and angst?

Another announcement over the PA. London calling. We land in less than an hour—my old life, America, Montréal, and the waters of the North Atlantic at our backs.
