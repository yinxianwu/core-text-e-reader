Flanders to Funsterdam
Bruges & Amsterdam

<font color="black" strokeColor="gray" face="Palatino">“It’s about as exciting as riding BART to Oakland.”

That was one friend’s take on the Eurostar trip beneath the English Channel. But nay, I refuse, <font face="Palatino Italic">refuse<font face="Palatino">, to be so blasé about the engineering triumph of the late-twentieth century. When I heard of the completion of the EuroTunnel—the rail tube running between Britain and mainland Europe—I vowed to make it my first Channel crossing. In spite of cost overruns, initially low ridership, and—only a few weeks before I board—a fire in the tunnel that reduces service, nothing stands in my way of crossing this body of water without leaving terra firma—or, for that matter, my seat.

The escalator offers a slow-motion reveal of the long, sleek, blue-yellow-and-white tube of wheeled steel. Even though I’m in First Class, my plushy gray seat is a bit worn—a reminder that all this is business-as-usual travel in these parts.

The Brits recently—and at long last—completed their high-speed rail link from the tunnel opening near Dover right into the heart of London. To go with it, they remodeled St. Pancras railway station, a soaring masterpiece of red-brick Victorian gothic revival. So grand was this station that it stood in for neighboring Kings Cross in the <font face="Palatino Italic">Harry Potter<font face="Palatino"> films; before boarding I spot a luggage trolley embedded into a brick wall below a sign for “PLATFORM 9 ¾.”

As we glide out of the station on time, a voice comes over the intercom indicating that service will be slower due to the fire. <font face="Palatino Italic">Uh-oh<font face="Palatino">. I envision hours-long delays, like those at U.S. airports during thunderstorm season. The conductor, in English and French, obligingly details the delay to profuse apology.

“We’ll be arriving in Brussels nine minutes behind schedule.”

<font face="Palatino Italic">Tragedy<font face="Palatino">.

<mov src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/movies/Eurostar.jpg" clip="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/movies/EurostarSmall.mp4" width="320" height="240">

High-speed rail lines are purpose built: their solid welded tracks, curved embankments to handle centrifugal forces, and grade-separated construction (no street-level crossings) facilitate speeds in excess of 150 miles an hour. To enable such velocity, these trainsets—using the same TGV technology as those in France—are known as “EMU.” Not after the animal, but short for “Electric Multiple Unit.” Each train car is a locomotive in and of itself. As we leave suburban London and reach the countryside around Kent, I spot cars on the freeway traveling at half our speed.  

Soon after—black. Yes, twenty-some minutes inside a tunnel should be as exciting as watching grass grow, but it’s the <font face="Palatino Italic">idea<font face="Palatino"> of it—the dream of centuries, confounding Napoleon and scores of others with conquest or connectedness on the brain. Now it’s the province of bored Euro-commuters who are unwittingly transforming the London-Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam nexus into one West European mega-center. Some may cringe but for me it’s a delight.  

We emerge on the other side and on the surface, nothing’s changed: more rolling green fields, more country roads, a smattering of cars. But look closer: the signage is French, the cars right-hand drive. The Continent awaits!

Brussels is boring. Or so they say. I don’t bother finding out as I’m more interested in one of Belgium’s smaller centers. Sleepy and forgotten for centuries, nowadays it’s hot on the tourist map—at least if the plethora of guidebook sales is to be believed. It was even the star of a recent indie crime thriller: <font face="Palatino Italic">In Bruges<font face="Palatino">.

Bruges is perhaps the ideal spot to indulge anyone’s “how did it get that way?” fixation. It was, by my estimation, the New York City of the 1200s: a Middle Ages trading powerhouse equivalent to the London of the day. But times and the city’s fortune changed: West Flanders declined in power and importance, and the city’s river silted in, leaving Bruges cut off from the sea. (A latter-day nearby port, Zeebrugge, retains some importance.)  

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/BrugesMarktDusk.jpg" width="320" height="240">

An early-evening reconnoiter reveals few cars but lots of bicycles speeding along the narrow, curving streets. I’m nearly jingle-belled to death, a fate I suspect the Brugians enjoy inflicting on the hordes of tourists passing through their burg. I reach Markt, the main town square, shrouded in the moody mist. It’s adorably lined with upscale touristy eateries and stairstep-gabled roofs. With lights aglow and horses atrot on the cobbles, it’s hard not to feel overcome with nostalgia and romance and think…

<font face="Palatino Italic">Wow, it feels just like Disneyland.<font face="Palatino">

There’s more to that sentiment than dumb Americana: Walt and his team of “imagineers,” in re-enacting medieval town centers with toy-like precision, were actually on to something that town planners of the 1950s utterly failed to appreciate. People <font face="Palatino Italic">enjoy<font face="Palatino"> spaces like these for their scale, their accessibility, their mix of residence and commerce, church and hearth. It was only decades later when urban gentrification took root that architects and city officials paid heed; nowadays everyplace wants to be Bruges, or Bruges-esque.

<font face="Palatino Italic">That’s not English they’re speaking<font face="Palatino">. Glottal Flemish carries on the soggy breeze. So what? I grew up in a city where English was the minority, and that’s partly why this pricks up my ears. Secessionist-era Quebec wasn’t exactly the friendliest to Anglophones. Aside from my hometown, I haven’t visited a non-English-speaking place in decades, and perhaps the stale memory of that tense time partly accounts for that. Still, Flemish and English share common roots, as evidenced by looking around: a sign over a local pub bears a polished black wood-carved feline with wording above that reads “DE KAT.”

“They’re called ‘smartshops.’”

So says a hefty Canadian guy. He and five of his friends—two others guys and two girls—are sitting in a circle drinking beer in my hostel’s chandelier-draped common room. They’ve just come from Amsterdam, and, like all independent travelers this side of northwestern Europe, they’re eager to share the lowdown on substances elsewhere illicit.

In this case, psilocybin, magic mushrooms. The fungal-based hallucinogen is, in addition to cannabis, available at retail outlets in Holland, though only at specific establishments. <font face="Palatino Italic">Everyone’s got a specialty.<font face="Palatino"> Mushrooms have been on my to-do list for a number of years, so this whets my curiosity.

For now, however, I must address my <font face="Palatino Italic">real<font face="Palatino"> substance abuse problem. I cannot for the life of me understand the dismissal, by certain U.S. officials, of Belgium and France as “chocolate-making countries.” Uhm, this is a <font face="Palatino Italic">bad<font face="Palatino"> thing? Screw the museums and architecture…<font face="Palatino Italic">this<font face="Palatino"> is why we come to Europe, at least this part of it.

I hold—with what some dismiss as religious fervor, but what do they know?—that chocolate is best served with…more chocolate. None of this jellied fruit crap they keep trying to stick inside otherwise-respectable devil’s food cake. Though the odd fresh strawberry makes for a nice accompaniment, and banana even better. But best of all…oh yeah, there it is, sold here on pushcarts on the street: a waffle. Calling it “Belgian” would be redundant.

Since I’ve never seen it back home, I try the denser, chewier “Liege-style” variety…drizzled with chocolate syrup, of course. Oh sure, it’s touristy: I’m guessing not one of this vendor’s clientele is local. But really, <font face="Palatino Italic">so what<font face="Palatino">?

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/BrugesChocolateBreasts.jpg" width="240" height="320">

More awaits in a nearby shop window: all manner of cacaoy bon bons, including a bunch done up as women’s breasts—ah, Europe! I resist the pull, however, and offer up a pledge to keep my girlish—uhm, boyish—waistline. Looking up at the church tower looming over Markt, I offer up a mantra to the gods of vanity and good health: <font face="Palatino Italic">I shall climb every major church steeple or cathedral tower<font face="Palatino">.  

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/BellTowerSteps1.jpg" width="240" height="320">

Here in Bruges, that translates into 353 steps. Hardly a challenge for those in decent shape…well, okay, <font face="Palatino Italic">something<font face="Palatino"> of a challenge: huffing and puffing a bit in the rarified air up top, I take in the sweeping view. Aside from the odd steeple everything’s a couple of stories tall, a prairie of humble roofs. All cities looked like this once, before the advent of structural steel and reinforced concrete

To polish off Bruges, I discover—what else?—the town’s Chocolate Museum. More than cutesy displays hosted by cartoon elves, this place edifies: Belgium’s reputation as a confectionary powerhouse emerged through dominance of cacao-producing regions of Southeast Asia—though the bean itself emerged in Mesoamerica, in the New World.

A surly ticket agent and two more train rides and I’m in Noord-Holland, in Amsterdam. Ditching the hostel scene for a spell, I find a reasonably priced, stylish, newly opened boutique hotel in a flat-façaded four-story townhome on Amsterdam’s Rodeo Drive, Pieter Cornelius Hoofstraat. Actually, make that five stories: the little top-floor room they give me feels just like an artist’s garret, complete with dormer window. It’s close enough to the Rijksmuseum that I hear its carillon chiming on the quarter-hour.  

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/AmsterdamSignCU.jpg" width="320" height="240">

Like every bud-fiend passing through these parts I beeline it to a coffeeshop. John Travolta’s character from <font face="Palatino Italic">Pulp Fiction<font face="Palatino"> had it right: cannabis is legal but it ain’t a hundred percent legal. The shops cannot advertise what they’re selling, and lighting up on the street is <font face="Palatino Italic">verboten<font face="Palatino">. Interestingly, Dutch use of the stuff actually is lower than in many other countries; the coffeeshop contains mostly foreigners, though this is one time I’m happy to have the brand “tourist” stamped on my forehead. On the recommendation of some friends I stop in at Grey Area, a tiny establishment run by some expat Americans—the mellowest ones I’ve seen. The joint (pun intended) is festooned with colorful signs and bumper stickers; what <font face="Palatino Italic">is<font face="Palatino"> it with cannabis culture and the overuse of goofy signage?  

A friendly trio from Chicago, meanwhile, sits at a tiny round table, perplexed. They turn to me.

“Do you know how to use this thing?”

They’re trying to make head-or-tail of the Volcano, a vaporizer parked on the table surface. Its polished conical surface terminates in an inflatable clear-plastic enclosure, a mini hot-air balloon. This is the healthy way to smoke pot—by not smoking it at all. Instead a heating element deep inside this mini eruption coaxes “vapors” out of hashish. We soon figure it out: the balloon inflates with cannabis-infused air, and we take turns emptying it. Soon we’re all feeling quite pleasant.

Sightseeing in this state is a new experience—though I doubt I’m the first visitor to do so. I nearly bump into a stern elderly Dutch woman who stares disapprovingly. I check out the Van Gogh Museum and wonder if Vincent also partook—no, he was just crazy. One factoid about the guy coaxes a chill: he painted for only eleven years, dying younger than I am today.

Across the broad grassy park of Museumplein is the Rijksmuseum. Too much to tackle in this addled state…but thankfully most of it’s under renovation. Ever since my days as a wannabe filmmaker Rembrandt and Vermeer have captivated: they were really, really into light—or rather, where it comes from. Shafts of sun pour through windowsills while domes of illumination issue weakly from candles.

Nighttime. Amsterdam needs no introduction as a gay mecca, its other lifestyle bona-fide on top of the almost legal weed. I stride down pub-saturated streets, anticipating the grandest gay nightlife scene the world has to offer…

<font face="Palatino Italic">Wait, where is it?<font face="Palatino">

A couple of places in and around the tongue-twistingly named Regulierdrawsstrat look promising: ultramodern furniture, fruity drinks, backlit bars. But they’re half-empty, and remain so as the evening gets later and later…even though it should be a busy weekend night in late September.

“Where is everybody?” I ask a classically Dutch fellow from Leiden, tall, long blonde hair, blue eyes.

“This is it.”

The subdued bars are no random slow night, he offers. “Better if you’re kinky,” he adds, wrinkling his nose at one place I’m thinking of visiting. If you’re into leather, bondage, big hairy “bears,” this is your town. Not so much for those, like me, into pretty boys. The hordes I’ve been seeing on the streets are (mostly) straight. Leiden boy, meanwhile, has a boyfriend and leaves soon after.

<font face="Palatino Italic">So much for post-gay.<font face="Palatino"> I wonder: as Western societies become more open, does the underground allure, the need to push the envelope, commensurately dissipate? Consider the film <font face="Palatino Italic">Party Monster<font face="Palatino">, which chronicles the travails of New York City club kids of the 1980s: fleeing repressive small-town America, they congregate in the Big Apple to do drugs, wear outlandish outfits, embark on radical self-expression. But what if they had nothing to flee from? Gazing at the glitzy yet deserted nightspots, I wonder whether Amsterdam can claim to have lost something in its pragmatic policy of acceptance.

Or perhaps my disappointment has an ulterior motive. I’d hoped to make this stop my Rome <font face="Palatino Italic">à la<font face="Palatino"> Fellini <font face="Palatino Italic">Satyricon<font face="Palatino">: willful indulgence as part of my bid to clean the mental slate. Perhaps this is a herald from the travel gods: try as one might, destinations are what they are, anticipation and expectation be damned.

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

Maybe the city’s other reputed vice will do the trick: testing out my Bruges hostel-mates’ theory, I happen upon one of those smartshops—oh, who am I kidding, I looked it up online—where magic mushrooms are clinically displayed in small illuminated acrylic cases.

“You probably want to start with something not too strong,” says the elderly lady behind the counter. “Like these.”

She pulls out a set of little fungal balls. The crisp white label reads “PHILOSOPHERS STONES.” I head back to my garret: a safe, comfortable place is a key component of any hallucinogen trip. I’m a bit nervous as I’m without a “trip guide”—a sober friend to ensure nothing untoward happens—and my mental state is still on shaky ground. But I feel the need to have this experience partly for those reasons.

It takes a while, but the Stones do start me up: lying in bed, I stare at my arm and find its fine, dark hairs twirling into spiderlike shapes—and in spite of being a mild arachnophobe, I don’t find this disturbing or upsetting. Meanwhile, running my hand along the wall almost feels as if I’m coalescing into the plaster.

But it’s the mental trip that does it: I daydream I’m at a big gathering, a barbecue or some such, with anyone who I’ve ever endured conflict, distancing, falling out. Only here everyone’s congenial. A mantra echoes, again and again: “We can all be friends.” The carillon of the Rijksmuseum chimes every so often, clanging accompaniment to the reverie. It’s cathartic, an aspirational dream of what could be, somewhere, sometime. I now understand why ancient pagan faiths included hallucinogens in their religious rites, and wonder if this is what’s missing from religion nowadays.

Hours pass. As reality begins to reassert itself, I feel the need to wander the city in the lurid night. I stroll through the red-light district—obviously I’m not its target market but the place captivates for another reason: it’s the oldest part of town, its streetscapes narrow as any in Bruges, though with a lot more neon and crowds. Crossing over the canals I come upon a building that looks oddly familiar: an incongruously modern-looking edifice trying to fit into the cityscape, brick walls and angular bay windows straddling a many-arched concrete base.

<font face="Palatino Italic">I’ve been here before.<font face="Palatino">

In my childhood mind’s eye, I remember it resembled one of my grandmother’s nightstands. On a layover to Canada from the Middle East sometime in the seventies my family stayed here overnight. But in this altered state, that otherwise-banal recollection takes on phantasmagorical significance: a marker stone in my nomadic life. I find myself overcome with gratitude at this welcoming, sheltering city that housed my clan of errant travelers, long, long ago.

So much for willful debauchery. Here in Europe’s pleasure capital the fates spur me toward deeper experiences. Even—especially—those chemically enhanced.</P>
