<font color="black" strokeColor="gray" face="Palatino">I pour down the jetway into a cloudy London morning filtering through windows of a building under renovation. A mess of exposed ceilings and faded, half-torn-out 1980s décor is my hello to the U.K. Heathrow’s Terminal Four is in use beyond its expected lifespan while kinks are ironed out at the flashy yet troubled new Terminal Five.

The building may reflect my unsettled mood, but not to worry: London serves as almost as good a refuge for me as Montréal, filled with close family friends and other chums.

“Seven months? Think you might consider going for longer?” asks Joy, an old family friend who’s come to “collect” me from the airport, as the British put it. I’m sitting in what should be the driver’s seat of her black Volkswagen Polo as we make our way to northwest London. Over a rolling sea of townhomes I spot the new Wembley Stadium, hulking and colossal.

“Maybe,” I reply. <font face="Palatino Italic">Like forever, even<font face="Palatino">. I listen up as she plies me with suggestions: like many Brits, Joy’s been all over. Once they colonized the world; nowadays they’re among the planet’s most intrepid travelers. The concepts of Gap Year and flashpacking originated in this island nation. Though Joy, more of an earthy type, tends to do things less princess-fashion than I’m intending.

“I never travel First Class,” she says. The expense normally precludes that for me too…but this trip sees me gifted with mileage upgrades. My so-so sleep last night on the plane is already making me salivate over those flat-bed seats.

I’m out walking with Bertie, Joy’s soft-spoken husband, to pick up Caribbean food (“take-away”) on Willesden’s curvy main high street dotted with little eateries. Three-story brick structures press close against the pavement while iconic red double-decker buses roar past at improbable speed. Harry Potter’s magical wizard bus wasn’t far off the mark.

<font face="Palatino Italic">At last, I’m elsewhere<font face="Palatino">. Mentally and physically alike. I’ve been waiting for it to hit me—that delightful culture shock sensation when all those elements of the unfamiliar reach critical mass. The feeling helps ease nerves still jangled by recent events.

So too does the food: the jerk chicken’s delightful, at once cementing that London’s boiled-cabbage days are long past; the city is as aflame with culinary diversity as any other major world center.

“Ooh, trendy,” Joy coos when I tell her and some friends where I’m headed for the evening. But the vibe is gentle, as are this crowd of convivial Brits. I sit with Joy, Bertie and some of their friends in the intimate, high-ceilinged living room in their little house off Willesden’s high street. Our conversation blends introductions and reminiscences: at fortysomething Joy’s the youngest of a clan whose rapport with my family goes back generations. Last time I was here—London’s one of a handful of international spots I’ve visited before—I was a closeted, fretful young teen and she a twentyish party girl.

“I fell asleep in <font face="Palatino Italic">Cats<font face="Palatino">,” she recounts. My parents had scored us tickets and she used the opportunity to sleep off a big night. This time the tables are turned: she and Bertie are parents of an adorable three-year-old and their sleepless nights, like those of my sibs in Montréal, now revolve around sippy-cups and storytime.

“Bring jetlag, thirst, and dancing shoes,” reads the e-mail from a friend of my sister’s who’s set to be my London nightlife guide. A handsome curly-haired fellow with a silken accent and a name taken from one of the painters of the Renaissance, he meets me at one of the nine entrances to the Old Street tube station. Londoners may grouse about their Underground, but they probably haven’t seen the farce of public transit that is San Francisco: halfway across town with two train transfers on a Saturday night takes barely thirty minutes.

Renaissance Man’s flat in Shoreditch is trendy indeed: a sliding steel doorway opens onto a quiet courtyard; his two-bedroom is a mess of exposed brick and photography gear belonging to his roommate, a chatty bespectacled gal from the American Midwest. I’m handed a “spliff,” cannabis Euro-style, a joint blended with tobacco. Then it’s off for the evening.

“See that?” Renaissance Man points to some artfully styled shape graffiti-ed in white paint on a wall outside his place. “He’s a well-known artist.”  

Shoreditch is a cauldron of activity, a once-dangerous stretch of inner-city transformed into a trendy fantasia of bars, fusion restaurants, and flats for office workers who want to live walking distance from the square-mile financial district known as the City. My habitually flawless gaydar pings uselessly—it’s near-impossible to tell the hets from the homos here. Renaissance Man, straight himself but with a friend circle that takes all comers, explains.

“We call this district ‘post-gay.’”

Indeed, members of all persuasions commingle more freely here than back home. Tippling too spills out onto the street, a phenomenon confined to only two cities I know of Stateside, Vegas and the Big Easy. It’s a good thing too, since frequent venue changes are mandatory to keep the buzz going: “pubs” close early, as they did in olden times; “bars” close later; and “clubs” stay open all night long.

There’s more than just drink to be had: all manner of substances flow as openly in this town as sexuality. From some known street vendors Renaissance Man scores some cocaine and powdered MDMA—stuff that hasn’t been readily available in America for years. I’m not one for snorting, but a dab on the tongue renders my mouth pleasantly numb and my psyche ready for what’s next.

Off to Heaven. The club, that is—a huge disco under the Charing Cross train station. Lots of cute boys but I’m not really in pick-up mode. Instead I sit with Renaissance Man in a cave-like chill-out space and compare life stories. His is pretty compelling: one of eleven children of a family of Italian peasant hippie Christians, he grew up all over the world before ending up in the U.K. working in West End London theatre. Now <font face="Palatino Italic">that’s<font face="Palatino"> not a bio you hear every day.

Ecstasy often serves as truth serum, which for me would normally mean retelling my recent melodrama in full. But not now, not this time. I shorthand it some, still trying to push it away. Renaissance Man picks up on that and gives me a brotherly pat.

“Let’s see if we can cheer you up.”

He puts on his wingman hat, trying to hook me up with a cute Italian boy from Torino sitting on the concrete outside the club: dark hair, pale skin, pupils the size of UFOs. Renaissance Man chats with him in Italian but the guy’s too cracked out, gnashing on a stir-stick to a plasticky pulp. No action for me—and Renaissance Man’s got a girlfriend—so it’s home by five a.m. The taxi ride to Willesden is glorious, passing Marble Arch and the elegantly lit-up buildings of the West End. The price tag is equally rich: for a five-mile trip it’s £30, which doing the math comes to…US$50. <font face="Palatino Italic">Ouch<font face="Palatino">.

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

Times have changed since I was here last. The pigeons and their droppings have vanished from Trafalgar Square. Odd-shaped skyrises of steel and glass crowd beside stone façades in the City—the gherkin’s my personal favorite, an ovoid sausage some forty stories tall. The once-forlorn Underground trains are a cheery blue, red, and white hurtling through century-old tunnels.

Nevertheless, some things resonate: the bored-looking young woman in the Manet painting at the Courtauld Collection. The chiseled lettering on the Rosetta Stone at the British Museum. <font face="Palatino Italic">But now I actually give a shit<font face="Palatino">. As a lad it felt like a chore, a duty, to see Sights of Great Importance. Now appreciation and interest flow effortlessly.

Joy’s parents, Sidney and Ray, hold mystical import in my family: my sisters and I owe them our very existence. Decades ago they cajoled my then-hesitant mother to call back the fellow with the unpronounceable name when both were here on a visit from opposite sides of the world. To commemorate the occasion I meet the elder pair at Fortnum &amp; Mason, a three-hundred-year-old department store whose top-floor St. James Restaurant has to be the best place to enjoy afternoon “cream tea”: a long, classically done-up chamber in a pastiche of blues and satin-white moldings. A grand piano provides the finishing touch. The tea and melt-in-your-mouth scones deliver the goods—as does the clotted cream, a buttery-looking but impossibly light concoction that lesser establishments try to substitute with the plain old whipped variety.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/SconesCU.jpg" width="320" height="240">

 Sidney and Ray make me reflect on how people age—something I think about more and more as the sun begins to set on my thirties. Fair-skinned Sidney is as chipper, jovial, and sharp as he was two decades ago: he segues from bad puns to discussions of computer software as effortlessly as I spread cream on my scones. His wife, Ray, a heavyset, olive-skinned woman whose jet-black hair has gone gray, is not so fortunate: her once sharp wit has turned hazy; a diagnosis made not long after my visit reveals she’s in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s.

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

Back at Renaissance Man’s place, he’s cooking up a fabulous pasta. At the table are his roommate Esther, his girlfriend Tanya, and Tanya’s tall, slender, long-fingered blonde roommate—a shy, sweet New Zealand gay boy named Sam. Alas, my near-instant crush on him isn’t reciprocated. In fact he looks almost uncomfortable in his alluring bit of gay getup: day-glo Converse and lurid-hued denim pants (“trousers, trousers”—“pants” are undergarments this side of the Atlantic).

We chug down more cocaine and weed—this time I get the gang to dig up a bong and smoke it unadulterated, the way the California cannabis gods intended. Then off for more carousing.  

Soho, London’s gay district, is dizzying even for me who’s seen it all Stateside: hordes of people spilling in and out of dozens of bars, discos, and everything in between. We end up at a more gender-blender spot, Circus. Sam gets into dancing like a pro—though later Tanya lets on it’s one of a very few times he’s been out on the town. His aloof demeanor is really just fear and inexperience. I can relate: that was me once upon a time, though Lord knows I didn’t dress nearly as well.

Late that night, back at Renaissance Man’s pad, I make a call.

“Hey baby.”

“How <font face="Palatino Italic">are<font face="Palatino"> you?” says Ryan in that polished, courteous tone honed from years of speaking to swimmer-kids’ parents. It’s our first call using Skype.

He’s keeping busy, but I can tell he’s a bit down.

“I want to keep a weekly phone date,” he says, “but I can’t do ‘hey baby’ for seven months. I don’t think I can handle that.”

Fair enough. I agree. No terms of endearment. Our conversation feels good, something of a smoothing out after the bumpy, conflicted farewell back in Denver. I’m not sure if we’re being unrealistic, trying to keep this pilot light going for all these months, but somehow it feels right: even in my desire to put the recent past in the rearview mirror, I relish the opportunity to glance occasionally back at the good parts. We’ll see how long that lasts.

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

London suburbs give way to iridescent rural green. The train tilts and glides north from Euston Station, up through the spine of England and into northern Wales. Fittingly, I see poxy white dots of grazing sheep in the field, and, farther on, hollowed-out ruins of ancient stone castles. I half-expect a gaggle of Monty Pythoners to turn up, on the run from airborne cows or killer bunnies.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/WelshCountrysideSheep.jpg" width="320" height="240">

We arrive under slate-gray skies at the ferryport in Holyhead, Wales. It’s pretty quiet; my guess is Tuesday in late September isn’t exactly peak season to cross the Irish Sea.

The term “ferry”—conjuring up in my memory those modest vessels across Lake Champlain in Vermont—almost seems like an insult to this behemoth. At around 600 feet long and over 20,000 tons displacement, this ship is the size of ocean liners of yore. Much of its space is reserved for vehicles, but there’s still ample room in the three or so passenger decks—which include three restaurants, two movie theatres, a deluxe “club lounge,” and a currency-exchange office—to spread out. I explore the vessel’s nooks and crannies and catch a nap on one of the leather sofas. A couple of hours later and we arrive in Dublin. My first-ever passport stamp in the European Union.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/UlyssesFerry.jpg" width="320" height="240">

Ireland’s done well in the EU. This is immediately apparent on the taxi ride along the riverbank into the central city: gleaming new office towers, upscale shops, gossamer-light metal footbridges traversing the river. The heavy gloss of prosperity.

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

“Why are you still in the room?”

It’s my first stay in a hostel and my abrupt intro to budget accommodation. This one’s got private rooms and I book myself into one, but on day two I’m told I need to switch rooms. It’s 10:30 and guests need to be out of the rooms by ten—and that’s not a suggestion as the burly middle-aged lady sent to tidy my room makes clear.

It’s also not the most congenial place. Its mezzanine-level common room is mostly empty; scattered individuals making use of free Wi-Fi sit in plushy armchairs. Looks like I may need to take matters into my own hands if I want to meet people. Not a problem: I long ago outgrew my fear of going out alone, a practice that holds far less stigma in gayland anyway.

As a mid-sized city (population a million-and-a-half or so) in a traditionally Catholic nation, Dublin’s reputedly a modest gay center. And it’s midweek—not exactly party time. Still, the pub-besotted town has become a drinking destination for Brits—stag and “hen” (as they call bachelorette) parties flit through the city’s raft of bars as I chow down on arguably the priciest burger I’ve ever eaten at a joint in Temple Bar, the city’s medieval-core-cum-tourist-mecca.  

The gay scene consists of a scattering of pubs nearby…though what’s supposed to be the biggest of these isn’t promising: The George looks like one of those dumpy gay bars from decades past. Small, dank, mostly empty. But wait—that’s just the antechamber. A much larger space hides upstairs, a glitzy multi-level affair replete with a dance-floor, a stage, and—soon after I arrive—a drag show. Not bad for a Wednesday night. Even the, uhm, ladies put out enough garishness and over-the-top humor to pass muster back home.

The crowd, meanwhile, is friendly and cute.  

“How old are you?” asks one tallish dark-haired fellow with pale skin, an echo of Ryan the swimmer but for his inky-brown eyes and hair. I tell him and he nearly keels over.

“Christ, I’m twenty!” he says. This city’s a big university town and bereft of America’s twenty-one-and-over drinking restrictions. The guy doesn’t blow me off altogether, amiably tapping me as he passes throughout the night. Meanwhile, on the dance floor, a waifish, fair-featured boy eyes me more eagerly. We dance, closer and closer, moving to embrace and eventually to making out. Then we introduce ourselves.

“I’m Michael,” he says. He’s even younger than the last one—nineteen—a science student from County Wexford attending Trinity College. <font face="Palatino Italic">I pegged him for a science geek<font face="Palatino">. Coyly fetching in size twenty-eight jeans, he’s the sort who’s too cute to be a nerd in real life but might be cast as one in some romantic comedy.

We walk hand in hand, past the elegantly lit-up shops of Grafton Street, across the banks of the River Liffey to my hostel. Good thing I scored that private room, I consider, as we make for the bed in passionate liplock. He stays the night, and on top of the usual bedroom activities—kudos to youthful libido—we end up chatting till dawn.  

“So did you see <font face="Palatino Italic">Far & Away<font face="Palatino">?” I ask. I’m always curious to know how locals feel about Hollywood depictions of their homeland.

“Yes,” he replies, eyes rolling. Hardly necessary, but he confirms Tom Cruise’s Irish brogue is pitiable. He may not know it yet but he’s a charmer, this boy—and not just thanks to his near-perpetual, beefy erection that literally lasts all night. I tell him he’s cute and he shakes his head, bashful, mouthing, “I’m <font face="Palatino Italic">not<font face="Palatino">.”  

I’m <font face="Palatino Italic">such<font face="Palatino"> a sucker for modesty.

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

As I stop for breakfast the small voice in my head returns: <font face="Palatino Italic">should you really be hooking up now?<font face="Palatino"> It could be called fucking my way into distraction. Or maybe not: at this point the companionship of others, however temporary, feels right. Part of the journey, I guess.

Meanwhile, on to daytime activities: sitting in a bagel joint in Temple Bar begins to rev up my curiosity machine. <font face="Palatino Italic">How did it get that way?<font face="Palatino"> The neighborhood, not the bagel place. It’s the question that nags constantly for the curious, history-minded traveler—this one at least—that is, whenever nightlife and tumescent nineteen-year-olds aren’t keeping me otherwise distracted.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/TempleBar.jpg" width="240" height="320">

A few plaques on buildings reveal that Temple Bar is not named for its present-day use as sousing central (though of course there is a bar <font face="Palatino Italic">called<font face="Palatino"> the Temple Bar…that turn of phrase was too good to pass up). Wandering its narrow laneways lined with townhomes in the sober light of day, I learn it’s named for the riverbank on which it sits. Nearby is an equally misnamed relic, a sprawl of mismatched structures. Dublin Castle.

<font face="Palatino Italic">English, Irish, whatever<font face="Palatino">: I knew about the I.R.A. and Home Rule and all that, but in North America it’s a blurry distinction, Celt from Briton. Well, not here: the English controlled Ireland for eight hundred years, and the center of their power was this sprawling complex with an Anglo-Norman tower—okay, <font face="Palatino Italic">this<font face="Palatino"> part looks like a castle—at its heart.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/DublinCastleTower1.jpg" width="320" height="240">

Another icon looms not far away. <font face="Palatino Italic">My first church in the Old World<font face="Palatino">, I muse while ambling into soaring St. Patrick’s Cathedral. <font face="Palatino Italic">Probably not the last<font face="Palatino"> is the thought that immediately follows. Still, this place provokes a tremble: it’s <font face="Palatino Italic">the<font face="Palatino"> St. Patrick’s. Built on the spot where the man himself began Christianizing the Irish circa 500 AD.

Confession: religion isn’t my thing. Not even my own. Not even the innocuous-seeming Eastern faiths popular back home. All those praying practitioners reciting lurid tales of the fantastical beyond—“fairy tales,” cynics like comedian Bill Maher call it; all those rituals that captivate many but feel empty to me…I just don’t get it. Sure, I wonder about what’s out there and hold an Einsteinian fascination with the grandeur of creation. I’m just left blank at humankind’s attempts to express such things through organized faith. “Retail religion,” I call it. The events of last summer didn’t help: part of my falling out with my friend Steve had to do with his newfound sense of spirituality, the Northern California variant of religious awakening.

But enough of that. Sitting in a pew beneath the tall stone walls and vaulted ceiling it’s hard not to be enthralled by the artistry primed by faith. I consider, much like that scene in Richard Linklater’s <font face="Palatino Italic">Before Sunrise<font face="Palatino">, how inspiring this place must have been to those sad, lonely souls seeking solace and comfort. Never mind the supernatural: for me the edifice itself holds the power to uplift.

Some organ music plays, brooding and rich, for a quarter-hour or so. Walking around, I discover this was the very place where Handel’s <font face="Palatino Italic">Messiah<font face="Palatino"> was first performed in 1742. Around the same time, Jonathan Swift was Dean.

<img src="SectionDivider169Black.png" width="84" height="16">

And now for something completely different.

On the taxi ride into town a couple of days earlier I spotted a number of signs advertising adventure-style boating excursions—“Sea Safaris”—heading out on the river into Dublin Bay. At first I’m skeptical. <font face="Palatino Italic">Too touristy<font face="Palatino">. But it’s a five-minute walk from the hostel. Plus, it’s as good an opportunity as any to test out that quick-drying clothing all those backpacking books cajoled me to buy.

“There’s a crowd of twenty or so coming,” indicates the fellow running the place out of a waterfront booth. Almost as soon as he says it, they materialize: chatty, amiable, all business-casual khakis and button-down shirts. A gang of office workers from one of the glassy waterfront buildings nearby. AIB to be exact, Allied Irish Bank (no relation to the troubled AIG back home) out on a “team-building exercise”—something I’ve done myself more than once in my career as a corporate grunt. As we head down the Liffey, past derelict industrial buildings and out toward open water, we compare notes on cities and workplace cultures. As I suspected: techie Ireland is a lot like San Francisco.

We pick up speed once out on the Bay. The boats engage in a bit of a splashing and 180-degree spins in the water.

“I’m drenched!” screams a blonde lady sitting at the prow. Glad I plunked myself in the spongy middle of the boat, ensuring my camera will live to photograph another day. We rumble past rocky islands dotted with abandoned stone forts and old lighthouses.  

“See that water,” our guide says, pointing to the surface. A layer of liquid is peeling back like a bedsheet. “That’s the tide going out.” I’m told this is the sunniest day in Dublin in weeks, and we’re all a bit warm out on the water in musty-smelling orange life preservers.

<img src="http://www.holisticideas.com/wtrmobile/images/SeaSafariAIBGuys3.jpg" width="320" height="240">

We return to the dock exhilarated. Valuable Lesson for me, the diligent planner: stick my nose out of the guidebook or Wikitravel page and just go with the flow sometimes.

A final spin through the city schools me in more history: from the National Museum, located in an austere old army barracks just west of the center, I learn about the 1916 Easter Rising that led directly to Irish independence in 1922. A stroll back along the Liffey leads me to broad O’Connell Street, where a new monument—the Dublin Spire—has been erected at its center. The term “erected” is apt for this long, slender needle of skinny brushed metal. Still, it manages to harmonize with the lumbering stone structures around it.

<font face="Palatino Italic">Okay, this worked<font face="Palatino">. My first-ever outing as a solo backpacker. My first fling on European soil. Some success distracting myself from past events. Granted, it was gentle terrain: aside from the Gaelic on street signs Dublin could be any funky mid-sized city back home. But it casts the die for what’s to come: discover a new place, find new friends (occasionally with benefits), reconnect with old ones (where they exist). Shake, stir, reflect as needed. The moody, rainy British Isles did the trick: I leave with spirits lifted, new chums acquired, old connections rekindled…not to mention a newfound appreciation for the boys of Dublin.</P>
